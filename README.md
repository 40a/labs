# {code} Demos

What's the point of having awesome software if you can't show it off?

## Guidelines

1. Create a new folder with the title of your demo
2. Add all relevant code and step-by-step instructions for completing the demo
3. Remember that these are quick "demos" and not "tutorials"
4. Create a README.md file for each demo to display on GitHub that lays out the instructions for completing your demo from start to finish.
5. Screenshots are encouraged.
